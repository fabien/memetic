This project creates a number of binary rubygems that encapsulate CouchDB. The gems are
platform specific, and don't require native compilation when installed.

Once you have installed the gems you can create/start/stop an instance of CouchDB like this:

require 'rubygems'
require "memetic-couchdb"

DB = Memetic::CouchDB.new("#{Dir.pwd}/development-db")
DB.add_external("search", "ruby #{Dir.pwd}/search/external.rb")
DB.add_erlang_path("#{Dir.pwd}/search/")
DB.add_configuration("log", "level", "debug")
# DB.add_configuration("httpd", "port", "5985")
puts DB.start
puts 'Hit enter to stop'
gets
puts DB.stop

Alternatively, you could have different scripts to do each action sharing a common DB setup,
or you might embed the entire control process without another application.
